# Overview

## Integrated Fossil source control

### Prerequisites

> This extension leverages your machine's Fossil installation,
so you need to
[install Fossil](https://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/quickstart.wiki)
first. Also read the [cloning](/docs/cloning.md) documentation for info
about cloning from the extension.

## WORK IN PROGRESS. PLEASE SUBMIT [ISSUES](https://github.com/koog1000/vscode-fossil/issues) IF YOU FIND THEM.

# Features

* Add files and commit from the source control side-bar
  (i.e. where git normally appears).

* All the basics: commit, add, revert, update, push and pull.

* See changes inline within text editor.

* Interactive log for basic file history and diff.

* Branch, merge, resolve files.

* Quickly switch branches, push and pull via status bar.

* Supports named-branches workflows.

* Automatic incoming/outgoing counters.

* Undo


## View file changes

    * Follow prompts

## Update to a branch/tag

![Change branches](images/change-branch.gif)

  * The current branch name is shown in the bottom-left corner.
  * Click it to see a list of branches and tags that you can update to.

# Settings

`fossil.enabled { boolean }`

  * Enables Fossil as a source control manager in VS Code.

`fossil.autoUpdate { boolean }`

  * Enables automatic update of working directory to branch head after
  pulling (equivalent to `fossil update`)
  *  `"true"` &mdash; enabled
  *  `"false"` &mdash; disabled, manual update/merge required

`fossil.autoRefresh { boolean }`

  * Enables automatic refreshing of Source Control tab and badge counter
  when files within the project change:
  `"true"` &mdash; enabled
  `"false"` &mdash; disabled, manual refresh still available.

`fossil.path { string / null }`

  * Specifies an explicit `fossil` file path to use.
  * This should only be used if `fossil` cannot be found automatically.
  * The default behaviour is to search for `fossil` in commonly-known
    install locations and on the PATH.

`fossil.username { string / null }`

  * Specifies an explicit user to use for fossil commits.
  * This should only be used if the user is different than the fossil default user.

# Troubleshooting

In general, Fossil designers maintain an abundance of
[documentation](https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/permutedindex.html).
Reference that documentation as much as possible.

| Issue | Resolution
--------|----------------------------------------------------------------
| Unknown certificate authority | Read the [Fossil SSL Documentation](https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/ssl.wiki#certs) to update fossil with the correct CA |
| inputBox prompt difficult to read | Run the same fossil command on the built-in terminal (<code>Ctrl+`</code>). Unfortunately VS Code strips newlines and tabs from inputBox prompts. |

# Building Extension from Source
**Note:** The official way to install vscode-fossil is from within
[VSCode Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_browse-for-extensions)

### Dependencies
You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
on your computer and add it to your `$PATH`.

### Build Steps

2. `npm install` from clone directory to install local dependencies
3. `npm run compile` to build extension.
