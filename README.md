# Overview

## Integrated Fossil source control

### Prerequisites

> **Note**: This extension leverages your machine's Fossil installation, so you need to [install Fossil](https://www.fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/build.wiki) first.

## NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS. NOT READY FOR RELEASE.

* See changes inline within text editor.

* Interactive log for basic file history and diff.

* Branch, merge, resolve files.

* Quickly switch branches, push and pull via status bar.

* Supports named-branches workflows.

* Automatic incoming/outgoing counters.

* Undo

# Settings

`fossil.enabled { boolean }`

  * Enables Fossil as a source control manager in VS Code.


`fossil.pushPullScope { all / current / default }`

  * Specifies what to include in Push/Pull operations.
  * For named-branches mode: &nbsp;
  `"all"` &mdash; all branches / unrestricted (this is the default)
  `"current"` &mdash; only includes changesets for the current branch
  `"default"` &mdash; only includes changesets for the _default_ branch

`fossil.autoUpdate { boolean }`

  * Enables automatic update of working directory to branch head after pulling (equivalent to `fossil update`)
  `"true"` &mdash; enabled
  `"false"` &mdash; disabled, manual update/merge required

`fossil.autoInOut { boolean }`

  * Enables automatic counting of incoming/outgoing changes.
  * When enabled, these show in the status bar.
  * Updated every 3 minutes, or whenever a commit/push/pull is done.
  * Note: when `fossil.pushPullBranch` is set to `"current"` or `"default"` then only the respective branch will be included in the counts.

`fossil.autoRefresh { boolean }`

  * Enables automatic refreshing of Source Control tab and badge counter when files within the project change:
  `"true"` &mdash; enabled
  `"false"` &mdash; disabled, manual refresh still available.

`fossil.countBadge { tracked / all / off }`

  * Controls the badge counter for Source Control in the activity bar:
  `"tracked"` &mdash; only count changes to tracked files (default).
  `"all"` &mdash; include untracked files in count.
  `"off"` &mdash; no badge counter.

`fossil.allowPushNewBranches { boolean }`

  * Overrides the warning that normally occurs when a new branch is pushed:
  `"true"` &mdash; new branches are pushed without warning (default).
  `"false"` &mdash; shows a prompt when new branches are being pushed (e.g `fossil push --new-branch`)

`fossil.path { string / null }`

  * Specifies an explicit `fossil` file path to use.
  * This should only be used if `fossil` cannot be found automatically.
  * The default behaviour is to search for `fossil` in commonly-known install locations and on the PATH.
